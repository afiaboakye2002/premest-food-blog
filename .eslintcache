This allows it to come to room temperature and ensures even cooking.\r\n \r\n Dry the steaks and leave the fat on. Pat the steaks dry with paper towels for that perfect outer crust. If you want to cut the fat off the steak, do it once it’s cooked as fat adds flavour and moisture to the meat while it’s cooking.\r\n  \r\n Don't add oil to the pan. Instead, brush the steaks with oil and season all over with a little salt and pepper.\r\n  \r\n It's all about the sizzle. Preheat a large frying pan (or BBQ) to a high heat. If using a frying pan, the heavier the base, the better – heavy-based pans hold heat longer and cook the meat evenly. It’s important not to overcrowd the pan or BBQ, or the meat will stew rather than sear. Cook the steak in batches or use two pans if need be. You should hear a big sizzle when the steak hits the pan – no sizzle means the pan isn’t hot enough.\r\n  \r\n The timing. As a rule of thumb (for a steak 22mm thick) – cook 2 minutes each side for rare, 3-4 mins each side for medium-rare and 4-6 mins each side for medium. For well done, cook for 2-4 minutes each side, then turn the heat down and cook for another 4-6 minutes.\r\n  \r\n To test for doneness, use the tip of your clean index finger (or tongs) to gently prod the steak. If the steak is soft and squishy, it’s rare. If it’s soft but a bit springy, that’s medium-rare. If it’s springy, that’s medium. Any firmer than that and it’s on its way to well done.\r\n  \r\n Allow the steaks to rest. Place the steaks onto a wooden board or plate, cover loosely with foil and rest for about 6-7 minutes before slicing across the grain or serving. Resting will allow the meat to relax, and the juices will return to the meat fibres. This means the juices won’t run out on to the plate when you cut the steak – and results in more tender steak.</p><button className=\"but\">Get Recipe</button></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                <div className=\"blog-post\" ><h3>Saucy Pasta</h3><img style={{width:'100%',borderRadius:\"5px\",}}src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1565976469782-7c92daebc42e?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2134&q=80\"/><p className=\"post\">Take the meat out of the fridge 20-30 minutes before cooking.

Just after completing his primary school level his life took a turn. He was unable to peruse further studies and to make matters worse, his father became ill. Benson’s family used-up most their wealth paying medical bills, leaving them with very little to sustain themselves. As the eldest child in a family of 38 siblings, Benson was therefore forced to take up the responsibility of taking care of his family.</p><p>His interest in food recently made him travel Europe for an exchange program courtesy of Basecamp Spitsbergen family. As they say, there is a first time for everything. Benson flew to Europe for the first time. During his tour, he had the opportunity to visit several places, including different restaurants where he got to taste great meals that were different from what Kenya had to offer. He also had time to explore the fine dining scene in Spitsbergen as well as interact with the best chefs at 78 degrees North.\r\n          Benson is a self-made success story. He has learned how to cook through experimentation. He has also incorporated a variety of food techniques by picking up some tips here and there from cookbooks and watching cooking shows on YouTube.</p></span></h2>\r\n        </div>\r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About\r\n",{"ruleId":"97","replacedBy":"98"},{"ruleId":"99","replacedBy":"100"},{"ruleId":"101","severity":1,"message":"102","line":6,"column":33,"nodeType":"103","messageId":"104","endLine":6,"endColumn":39},{"ruleId":"105","severity":1,"message":"106","line":14,"column":11,"nodeType":"107","endLine":14,"endColumn":205},{"ruleId":"97","replacedBy":"108"},{"ruleId":"99","replacedBy":"109"},{"ruleId":"110","severity":1,"message":"111","line":7,"column":13,"nodeType":"107","endLine":7,"endColumn":25},{"ruleId":"101","severity":1,"message":"112","line":3,"column":8,"nodeType":"103","messageId":"104","endLine":3,"endColumn":12},{"ruleId":"101","severity":1,"message":"113","line":4,"column":8,"nodeType":"103","messageId":"104","endLine":4,"endColumn":16},{"ruleId":"101","severity":1,"message":"114","line":5,"column":8,"nodeType":"103","messageId":"104","endLine":5,"endColumn":15},{"ruleId":"105","severity":1,"message":"106","line":13,"column":65,"nodeType":"107","endLine":13,"endColumn":280},{"ruleId":"105","severity":1,"message":"106","line":31,"column":65,"nodeType":"107","endLine":31,"endColumn":280},{"ruleId":"105","severity":1,"message":"106","line":49,"column":65,"nodeType":"107","endLine":49,"endColumn":280},{"ruleId":"110","severity":1,"message":"111","line":31,"column":28,"nodeType":"107","endLine":31,"endColumn":40},{"ruleId":"105","severity":1,"message":"106","line":7,"column":11,"nodeType":"107","endLine":7,"endColumn":184},"no-native-reassign",["115"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["116"],"no-unused-vars","'Switch' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","jsx-a11y/alt-text","img elements must have an alt prop, either with meaningful text, or an empty string for decorative images.","JSXOpeningElement",["115"],["116"],"jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid","The href attribute requires a valid value to be accessible.
