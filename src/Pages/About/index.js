          Benson grew up in Koiyaki sub location in Narok County. Just after completing his primary school level his life took a turn. He was unable to peruse further studies and to make matters worse, his father became ill. Bensonâ€™s family used-up most their wealth paying medical bills, leaving them with very little to sustain themselves. As the eldest child in a family of 38 siblings, Benson was therefore forced to take up the responsibility of taking care of his family.</p><p>His interest in food recently made him travel Europe for an exchange program courtesy of Basecamp Spitsbergen family. As they say, there is a first time for everything. Benson flew to Europe for the first time. During his tour, he had the opportunity to visit several places, including different restaurants where he got to taste great meals that were different from what Kenya had to offer. He also had time to explore the fine dining scene in Spitsbergen as well as interact with the best chefs at 78 degrees North.
          Benson is a self-made success story. He has learned how to cook through experimentation. He has also incorporated a variety of food techniques by picking up some tips here and there from cookbooks and watching cooking shows on YouTube.</p></span></h2>
